Hi, I'm @matiasfranck. I consider myself as a problem solver. I'm definitely not a developer, but I can write some code and automate stuff. My best works were all made in the ancient but still functional VBA and I use it inside Excel. Here you will see some of the projects I built for my current workplace in order to replace a lot of reports that were made by hand. Yes you read it correctly, by hand in 2021. So this are the things I came up with. Planning to put some of my Python skills into practice, so soon enough there will be more projects here. Welcome to my Github repository!
